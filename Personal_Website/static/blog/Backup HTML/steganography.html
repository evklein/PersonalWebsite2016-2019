<h2>Discovery</h2>
Several months ago, we began learning about basic image processing in my
 Computer Science class. While it was a fairly basic concept that I was already
 quite familiar with due to my prior experience in drawing cartoon dinosaurs and
  ghosts for small games, I still enjoyed the unit greatly and learned a lot
about the subject. I enjoyed actually making the various filters that you could
apply to an image, like sucking all but the green values out of an image, or
adding a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_print_toning#Sepia_toning">
sepia tone</a>.
After finishing the unit, I decided to create a poster showing off my new
knowledge of image processing.
<p>The result:</p>

<p>After proudly brandishing this fine piece of modern art on a programming/game
development community that I regularly visit, one user gave me a challenge
which I could use my new-found imaging knowledge with. It involved the use of
 something I had never heard of before called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">
 Steganography,</a> or <strong>the art of hiding things in plain sight.</strong>
 While it would be several months before I would begin to actually dip my toes
 into this fascinating cryptographic method, it immediately intrigued me as a
  tool and as an art form.</p>

<h1>Stegory</h1>
<p>In late November, as the stress of the holiday season and finals began to settle
 in, I decided to sit down and try out this 'Steganography' technique that I had
  heard about. What I came up with was a simple Steganography suite which I
  named 'Stegory,' which literally means 'to apply hiding.' Included in the
  suite is a a very simple GUI dedicated to encrypting images with other images,
   as well as decrypting them to reveal the original.</p>

My favorite way to describe Stegory and how it works is the 'Histiaeus's slave'
example. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiaeus">Wikipedia</a>:
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiaeus">"...according to
 Herodotus, Histiaeus was unhappy having to stay in Susa, and made plans to
  return to his position as tyrant of Miletus by instigating a revolt in Ionia.
  In 499 BC, <b>he shaved the head of his most trusted slave, tattooed a message
   on his head, and then waited for his hair to grow back. The slave was then
   sent to Aristagoras, who was instructed to shave the slave's head again and
    read the message</b>, which told him to revolt against the Persians."</blockquote>
The beauty of Steganography is that not only is the information being well hidden,
 but the fact that there even is any information being hidden. Cryptography may
 convey privacy, but Steganography conveys secrecy. After all, how can a hacker
 crack a code that he doesn't even know exists?

I decided to explore this magic using image processing, just to see what I could
 do with it.

<h2>LSB</h2>
<p>LSB or '<strong>l</strong>east <strong>s</strong>ignifigant <strong>b</strong>it'
encryption is one of the most common methods of image-based steganography. It
 works like this:</p>

<p>I have several 'carrier' values. Let's say these values are... 72, 39, 54. We
 convert them to binary numbers so we end up with 1001000, 100111, and 110110,
 respectively.</p>

<p>Now, let's say we have a carrier message, more commonly referred to as a
'payload.' Let's say our payload is 4. We want to hide the message '4' inside of
 those three carrier values that were listed above. We convert our payload to
  binary as well and we end up with 100.</p>

Let's lay these numbers out:
Carrier values:
<ul>
	<li>10010<u>0</u></li>
	<li>10011<u>1</u></li>
	<li>11011<u>0</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how the last digits of each carrier binary are underlined? There's a
reason for that. Those are the parts that are going to be encrypted. LSB
Steganography works by substituting the least significant bit of any value with
a payload value. You'll see why in a second, but first let's go ahead and
actually perform the encryption.</p>

<p>With our carrier '100,' we encrypt like this.</p>

<p>Our first value 10010<u>0</u> turns into 100100<u>1</u>.</p>
<p>Our second value 1001<u>1</u> turns into 10011<u>0</u>.</p>
<p>Our final value 11011<u>0</u> stays the same.<p>

<p>Now, if we convert these values back to decimal integers, we get 73, 38, and 54.
Compared to our original values of 72, 39, 54, you're able to tell that these
numbers have been altered, but you have to look at the bigger picture. If I did
this with RGB values within an image, would I even be able to tell the
difference between the new color?</p>

<p>Well, there's only one way to find out.</p>

<p>We have a single pixel, RGB (198, 4, 28). We want to encrypt this pixel with the
 message we were using previously, 4.</p>

<ul>
  <li>198: 1100011<u>0</u></li>
  <li>4: 0000010<u>0</u></li>
  <li>28: 0001110<u>0</u></li>
</ul>

<p>(You might be wondering why I automatically made these binary values 8-bit. I
 did this mostly for consistency's sake. Each value in RGB can only go from 0 to
  255, effectively making a single RGB pixel 24-bits long.) So, let's get to
  encrypting. If we encrypt the number 4 (100 in binary), 1 bit into each RGB
  value, we end up with a new color value: RGB (199, 4, 28). The human eye
  cannot detect the difference here. See for yourself:<p>
<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/color_differences.png" width="200" height="100" />

<p>Completely indistinguishable. This works <i>most</i> times.</p>

<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

<p>There are several problems with the LSB method.</p>

<p>For one, it's common. It is the most used and recognized Steganographic
method in image processing. There are programs dedicated to catching it and any
cryptographer with even the most elementary knowledge of Steganography will know
 to look for it.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with it is a problem that I commonly describe as
carrier/payload ratio. that in order to hide an entire image, the carrier has to
 be much, much larger than the payload. If you were to hide 1 bit of information
  inside of each RGB value for every pixel in the carrier image, the carrier
  would have to be 8 times larger, as you need 8 RGB values (so roughly
  2.66666666 pixels) to hide a single RGB value (0.33333333 pixels).</p>

<p>Even with these drawbacks, it is still an effective method, although I still
wouldn't recommend using it in a serious manner. You can do amazing things with
LSB, but not with LSB on it's own. You need flexibility and variation to really
make it worth it.</p>

<p>And that's how I came up with 3-2-3 encryption.</p>

<h1>3-2-3 and Variants</h1>

</p>3-2-3 encryption isn't necessarily something that I invented myself. It's
just a different method of LSB. I gave it its own name because I referred to it
 too much as 'the LSB variant.' It has its own system of variants, strengths,
 and weaknesses. In particular, 3-2-3 fixes (at least partially) the
 carrier/payload ratio problem. Instead of having the carrier be 8 times bigger
  than the payload, the carrier now only has to be <b>3</b> times bigger.
  Magical. 3-2-3 works in the same way that LSB does, but it does it in a
   different way: by encrypting more than 1 bit per RGB value.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<img src="../static/blog/Steganography/carrier.png"
 width="100" height="100" /><img src="../static/blog/Steganography/payload.png"
  width="100" height="100" />

<p>We have two pixels here. Now remember, 3-2-3 works on a 1:3 ratio. So this
carrier pixel can only contain 1/3 of the data from this payload pixel. But how
 can we seperate that data? Well, the answer is pretty simple: via RGB value.
  So this carrier pixel will only be able to carry ONE of the RGB values. We'll
   do red, because that's the first in the sequence of 'red, green blue.'</p>

<p>We start the same way as we did LSB. Convert any carrier values to binary.
We'll do 8-bit again because that is the length of an RGB value.</p>

<ul>
  <li>0: 00000000</li>
  <li>97: 01100001</li>
  <li>255: 11111111</li>
</ul>

<p>Our payload is 255, so 11111111. Now, we need to fit this entire value into
our 3 carrier values. How? By altering the carrier values to hold a certain
digit for each RGB value. <b>Three</b> for the first value, <b>two</b> for the
second, and <b>three</b> for the third. 3, 2, and 3. So we end up with:</p>

<p>00000<u>000</u> ➝ 00000<u>111</u></p>
<p>011000<u>01</u> ➝ 011000<u>11</u></p>
<p>11111<u>111</u> ➝ 11111<u>111</u> (stays the same)

<p>Convert back to integers and we end up with our new carrier values: 7, 99,
 and 255. Now, these numbers are actually quite different from each other. But
visually...<p>

<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/color_differences2.png"
 width="201" height="100" />

<p>The color difference here is significantly larger than the one in LSB, but
you'd have to open up these colors in two separate tabs and switch back and
forth rapidly in order to really spot the difference.<p>

<p>But how does a real hidden image look? Could you spot the difference easily?
 The answer is yes and no. You could spot the difference between an original
 image and a 3-2-3 image, but you'd have to really look close at the pixel
 values, or do the tab switching method (something I did a lot when testing
 Stegory).<p>

<p>Here's a few example photos. I would recommend pulling these into an image
 editor and examining the images in greater detail if you really want to get a
 sense of how much 3-2-3 distorts the carrier.<p>

width="300" height="88" />

<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/dog_example.png"
 width="300" height="103" />

<p>So  as you can see, both examples work quite well.</p>

<p>The fun thing about 3-2-3 is that each value is interchangeable. I could do
2-3-3, 3-3-2, or I could even change the numbers if I really wanted to and have
combinations like 4-3-1, or 2-2-4. I would not recommend doing that second
example, as the distortion from the image would be immense and easy to spot.<p>

<p>Like LSB, 3-2-3 has a lot of strengths and even gets away with improving the
carrier/payload ratio. 3-2-3 isn't perfect, however, as it comes with several of
its own headaches.<p>

<h3>Grayscale and other Annoyingly Incompatible Images</h3>
<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/gray_scale.png"
 width="300" height="168" />

<p>Grayscale images won't work with 3-2-3. This is due to the nature of how
greyscale images work. Greyscale images rely on having all 3 RGB values the same.
 So you'd never find a true greyscale image with a value like RGB (3, 27, 199)
 in it. There's definitely ways around this, but I'm not going to explore them.</p>

<p>Several other image patterns won't work, including images with all but one
RGB value sucked out. There are plenty more, but it would take me forever to
discover all of them.<p>

<h3>The Great Gradient Predicament</h3>
<p>I want to preface this by saying that when I first discovered this critical flaw,
I was <b>pissed.</b> While there is <i>some</i> distortion, and it might be
<i>possible</i> to tell the difference between an encrypted image and an
 original, nothing really compares to this critical flaw. The problem: 3-2-3
 just absolutely destroys gradients. They become severely pixelated and easily
 noticeable, even to somebody who isn't looking for flaws. The worst part about
  it is that gradients are <b>everywhere.</b> Any photos of car windows,
  sunlight cascading over a surface, anything like that looks severely distorted
   by 3-2-3. Here's an example:<p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We start with a carrier:</p>
<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/gradient.png"
 width="300" height="300" />
<p style="text-align: center;">And a payload...</p>
<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/dino.png"
width="300" height="180" />
<p style="text-align: center;">And then we encrypt, and we get...</p>
<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Steganography/gradient_awful.png"
 width="300" height="300" />
<p>Look at how messed up the gradient is! It is <b>super</b> obvious
that something is wrong. This is the worst thing about 3-2-3, a presents a pretty
good problem in the algorithm.</p>
<p>There's pretty much nothing that you can do here. LSB doesn't do this, at
least not to the noticeable extent that 3-2-3 does.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>To summarize what I said before: not only are you hiding the information, you
are hiding the very <b>fact</b> that you are hiding that information. It is a
beautiful thing that I imagine I would use in the future if I ever needed to
convey secret information to informants, or something like that (I always wanted
 to be a spy). I enjoyed my time with Stegory and will continue to work on it
 for a while in order to perfect and clean it. With 3-2-3, LSB, and the various
 flaws and strengths that accompany each, I feel I have successfully learned a
 lot about Steganography. Learning about the flaws like the Great Gradient
 Predicament and grayscale error were frustrating to discover, but helped me
 learn more about the process than I could from just researching it.<p>

<p>Overall,  Steganography, when done right, is an
extremely effective method of secret communication which should definitely be
taken into consideration during circumstances regarding  cryptography or other
privacy methodologies.</p>
