I had to make a recording section for my newest <a href="/portfolio/Song-Friend">
song writing application.</a> So I had to make a section of the app for
capturing audio.

<img class="image-center" src="../static/blog/Recording/screenshot.png" />

<p>The problem with this interface is that there was a feature I wanted which
	couldn't be easily implemented through Android's native <code
	class="prettyprint"><a
	href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html">
	AudioRecord</a></code> class. <code>AudioRecord</code> doesn't allow for
	start/pause/start recording. So I had to write my own way of doing it.</p>

<h1>Algorithm</h1>

<ol>
	<li>User begins recording. Capture all audio data to a <code
		class="prettyprint">byte</code> array.</li>
	<li>User pauses recording. Write all audio data to a temporary <code
		class="prettyprint">PCM</code> file, save this somewhere nice. In SongFriend
		 I have it saved to the <code class="prettyprint">/SongFriend/Temps/</code>
		 directory on the Android's SD card.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 1-2 until the user is finished recording.</li>
	<li>Create a master file, where all your audio data will finally come together
		 to make a complete audio track.</li>
	<li>Start the master file with the <a
		href="http://www.topherlee.com/software/pcm-tut-wavformat.html">44-byte WAV
		header</a> that goes onto every single <code>WAV</code> file.</li>
	<li>Begin to add your <code>PCM</code> files onto the end, concatenating each
		one to the end of the last until you are all out of data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Voila! You're done. You now have a completed audio file file that you can
	listen to.</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p><code>AudioRecord</code> in itself is actually pretty easy to use.</p>

<p>First things first, you'll need a size for your buffer.</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">bufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(
	SAMPLE_RATE, CHANNEL, ENCODING);</code></p>

<p>Then, to instantiate your <code class="prettyprint">AudioRecord</code>:<p>
<p><code class="prettyprint">AudioRecord audioRecord = new AudioRecord(
	MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC, SAMPLE_RATE, ENCODING, bufferSize);</code></p>

<p>You'll also need a <code>byte</code> array to store your data.<p>
<pre><code>byte[] audioData = new byte[bufferSize];</code></pre>
To read the actual data into its own file, I ran this on a seperate thread. The
code is below.<pre><code class="prettyprint">  @Override
    public void run()
    {
        FileOutputStream outputStream = null;
        ByteArrayOutputStream recordingData = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        DataOutputStream dataStream = new DataOutputStream(recordingData);

        try
        {
            outputStream = new FileOutputStream(writePath);
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        while (audioRecorder.isRecording())
        {
            audioRecord.read(audioData, 0, audioData.length);

            try
            {
                outputStream.write(audioData, 0, bufferSize);
            }
            catch (IOException e)
            {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        try
        {
            dataStream.flush();
            dataStream.close();
            if (outputStream != null)
                outputStream.close();
        }
        catch (IOException e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }</code>
</pre>
<p>I just want to point something out about this section:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">
				while (audioRecorder.isRecording())
        {
            audioRecord.read(audioData, 0, audioData.length);

            try
            {
                outputStream.write(audioData, 0, bufferSize);
            }
            catch (IOException e)
            {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }</code>
</pre>
<p><code class="prettyprint">audioRecord</code> takes the data from the
	microphone and dumps it into <code class="prettyprint">audioData</code>,
	that is its primary responsibility and job. Then, all the
	<code class="prettyprint">byte</code> data is written to an external file
	using <code>outputStream</code>. Now, every single time the user hits the
	record button again, a new file is created (I started all my file names with
	the corresponding number of how many times the user had started recording).
	So if a user starts and stops recording 3 times, there will be 3 files filled
	with raw PCM data.</p>

<h3>File concatenation</h3>

<p>All WAV files begin with a 44-byte header, which contains various
	information about the file such as encoding and sample rate.
	 <a href="http://www.topherlee.com/software/pcm-tut-wavformat.html">I used this
		  as a reference.</a> In terms of code, I simply used a <code
			class="prettyprint">DataOutputStream</code> and wrote directly into my
			final file.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">/* Header */
dataOutputStream.writeBytes("RIFF");
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.intToByteArray(36 + (length * 1 * 16 / 8)), 0, 4);
dataOutputStream.writeBytes("WAVE");
dataOutputStream.writeBytes("fmt ");
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.intToByteArray(16), 0, 4);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.shortToByteArray((short) 1), 0, 2);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.shortToByteArray((short) 1), 0, 2);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.intToByteArray(AudioUtilities.SAMPLE_RATE), 0, 4);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.intToByteArray(AudioUtilities.SAMPLE_RATE * 1 * 16 / 8), 0, 4);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.shortToByteArray((short) (1 * 16 / 8)), 0, 2);
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.shortToByteArray((short) 16), 0, 2);
dataOutputStream.writeBytes("data");
dataOutputStream.write(AudioUtilities.intToByteArray(length), 0, 4);
</code></pre>
<p>This is just an example of how I did it, and it's a little bit sloppy, but still a good example of how to do it.</p>

<p>The last step is to concatenate your PCM files to the end of the header. This
	 is actually pretty simple, so I won't provide any code for it. What you'll
	  want to do is go back through your temporary PCM files and then read then
		back into <code class="prettyprint">byte</code> arrays. Then combine all the
		 <code class="prettyprint">byte</code> arrays you've collected, followed by
		 using your <code>DataOutputStream</code> to write to your final file.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
